    Function stackImagesHorizontally(path1, path2, outputPath)
        Load two images from path1 and path2
        Create a new image with dimensions to fit both images side by side
        Copy each image into its position
        Save the combined image to outputPath

    // Method to outline black areas in an image
    Function outlineBlackAreas(inputPath, outputPath)
        Load image from inputPath
        Convert image to grayscale
        Apply threshold to detect black areas
        Find contours of black areas
        Draw contours on the original image
        Save the outlined image to outputPath
